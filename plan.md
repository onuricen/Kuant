## 3. Hybrid ML Framework Architecture

### 3.1 Two-Stage Architecture Design

#### Stage 1: Pattern Recognition Network (PRN)
**Purpose**: Identify high-probability trading patterns and market conditions
**Architecture**: Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) or Informer Encoder
```
Input Layer: [lookback_periods, features] with temporal encoding
    ↓
Static Covariate Encoder: Market regime, session type, day of week
    ↓
Variable Selection Networks: Adaptive feature importance weighting
    ↓
Temporal Processing:
  - Historical Encoder: Multi-head attention on past observations
  - Future Decoder: Attention-based pattern projection
    ↓
Quantile Outputs: P10, P50, P90 price predictions for risk assessment
    ↓
Classification Head: [Long_Probability, Short_Probability, Market_Confidence]
```

**Training Approach**: Multi-task learning with quantile regression and classification
**Labels**: Future price movements, quantile predictions, and 2:1 RR trade success
**Loss Function**: Combined quantile loss + focal loss for classification
**Key Advantages**: 
- Temporal attention mechanisms capture long-range dependencies in price patterns
- Variable selection networks automatically identify most predictive features
- Quantile predictions provide uncertainty estimates for risk management
- Static covariate processing handles market regime changes effectively

#### Stage 2: Reinforcement Learning Decision Agent (RLDA)
**Purpose**: Optimize trade execution and risk management decisions
**Architecture**: PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
```
State Input: [TFT_outputs, Market_state, Position_state, Risk_state]
    ↓
Actor Network: Dense(256) → Dense(128) → Dense(64) → Action_probs
Critic Network: Dense(256) → Dense(128) → Dense(64) → Value_estimate
```

**Integration Method**:
```python
# TFT/Informer provides sophisticated pattern analysis
tft_output = temporal_fusion_transformer(market_data_sequence)
long_prob, short_prob, confidence = tft_output.classification_head
price_quantiles = tft_output.quantile_predictions  # P10, P50, P90
feature_importance = tft_output.attention_weights

# RL Agent makes execution decisions with rich temporal context
rl_state = combine_state(
    pattern_probs=tft_output.classification_head,
    price_uncertainty=price_quantiles,
    feature_importance=feature_importance,
    position_info=position_info,
    risk_info=risk_info,
    session_info=session_info
)
action = rl_agent.act(rl_state)
```

### 3.2 Hybrid State Space Design

- **Uncertainty Measures**: Prediction intervals from quantile outputs

### 3.3 Hybrid Action Space
#### RL Agent Actions
- **0**: Hold/Wait (no action despite TFT signal)
- **1**: Execute Long Trade (when TFT suggests high long probability)
- **2**: Execute Short Trade (when TFT suggests high short probability)
- **3**: Close Position Early (override predetermined exits)
- **4**: Adjust Stop Loss (learned behavior at 50% TP level)
- **5**: Reduce Position Size (risk management override)

### 3.4 Hybrid Reward Structure
#### Multi-Component Reward System
```python
# Trading Performance Rewards
trade_pnl_reward = (realized_pnl / risk_amount) * 100

# Pattern Recognition Alignment Rewards
pattern_alignment = +10 if (trade_direction == tft_prediction and profitable)
pattern_penalty = -5 if (trade_direction != tft_prediction)

# Risk Management Rewards
risk_compliance = +5 if (position_size <= risk_limit)
drawdown_penalty = -50 if (account_drawdown > 5%)

# Execution Quality Rewards
timing_bonus = +3 if (entry_timing optimal based on TFT confidence)
```

## 4. Hybrid Training Strategy

### 4.1 Two-Phase Training Approach

#### Phase 1: Temporal Fusion Transformer Training
**Objective**: Train TFT to identify high-probability 2:1 RR setups with uncertainty quantification
```python
# Training Data Preparation for TFT
def create_tft_targets(price_data, lookback=200):
    targets = []
    for i in range(len(price_data) - lookback - 50):
        # Historical sequence for attention
        historical_sequence = price_data[i:i+lookback]
        
        # Future sequence for quantile prediction
        future_prices = price_data[i+lookback:i+lookback+50]
        
        # Multi-task targets
        quantile_targets = calculate_price_quantiles(future_prices)
        trade_success = check_2_to_1_trade_success(historical_sequence[-1], future_prices)
        
        targets.append({
            'quantiles': quantile_targets,
            'classification': trade_success,
            'sequence': historical_sequence
        })
    return targets

# TFT Training Loop with Multi-task Learning
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch in train_loader:
        tft_output = temporal_fusion_transformer(
            batch.historical_data,
            batch.static_covariates,
            batch.known_future_inputs
        )
        
        # Combined loss: quantile + classification + attention regularization
        quantile_loss = quantile_regression_loss(tft_output.quantiles, batch.quantile_targets)
        classification_loss = focal_loss(tft_output.classification, batch.trade_labels)
        attention_loss = temporal_attention_regularization(tft_output.attention_weights)
        
        total_loss = quantile_loss + classification_loss + 0.1 * attention_loss
        optimizer.step()
```

**Validation**: Out-of-sample pattern recognition accuracy, quantile prediction calibration, and trade success correlation

#### Phase 2: RL Agent Training with TFT Integration
**Objective**: Train RL agent to make optimal execution decisions using TFT intelligence
```python
# RL Training Environment with TFT Integration
class HybridTradingEnvironment:
    def __init__(self, tft_model):
        self.tft = tft_model
        self.reset()
    
    def step(self, action):
        # Get comprehensive temporal intelligence
        tft_output = self.tft.predict(self.current_market_sequence)
        pattern_probs = tft_output.classification_head
        price_quantiles = tft_output.quantile_predictions
        attention_weights = tft_output.attention_weights
        
        # Execute action with enhanced context
        reward = self.calculate_enhanced_reward(
            action, 
            pattern_probs, 
            price_quantiles,
            attention_weights
        )
        next_state = self.update_state_with_tft_context(action, tft_output)

## 5. Risk Management System
### 5.1 Hybrid Risk Management Integration
#### Pattern-Based Risk Assessment
```python
def calculate_trade_risk(tft_output, market_conditions):
    base_risk = 0.01  # 1% default
    
    # Adjust risk based on pattern confidence and uncertainty
    confidence_multiplier = tft_output.classification_confidence
    uncertainty_penalty = calculate_uncertainty_penalty(tft_output.quantile_spread)
    
    if confidence_multiplier < 0.7 or uncertainty_penalty > 0.3:
        return 0  # No trade if confidence too low or uncertainty too high
    
    # Apply reverse martingale
    adjusted_risk = apply_reverse_martingale(base_risk)
    
    # RL agent final risk decision with TFT context
    final_risk = rl_agent.adjust_risk(
        adjusted_risk, 
        tft_output, 
        market_conditions,
        uncertainty_measures=tft_output.quantile_predictions
    )
    
    return final_risk
```

### 5.2 Position Sizing Logic
```python
default_risk = account_balance * 0.01  # 1% of $100k = $1000
```

#### Reverse Martingale Implementation
```python
if previous_trade_result == "loss":
    if consecutive_losses == 1:
        current_risk = default_risk * 0.5  # $500
    elif consecutive_losses == 2:
        current_risk = default_risk * 0.25  # $250
    # Continue halving until win
elif previous_trade_result == "win":
    if current_risk < default_risk:
        current_risk = min(current_risk * 2, default_risk)
    # Reset to default risk once losses are recovered
```

### 4.2 Stop Loss and Take Profit Logic
#### 2:1 Risk-Reward Enforcement
```python
entry_price = current_market_price
stop_loss_distance = risk_amount / position_size
take_profit_distance = stop_loss_distance * 2

if long_position:
    stop_loss = entry_price - stop_loss_distance
    take_profit = entry_price + take_profit_distance
else:  # short_position
    stop_loss = entry_price + stop_loss_distance
    take_profit = entry_price - take_profit_distance
```

### 5.3 Dynamic Stop Loss Management
#### Hybrid Stop Loss Optimization with Temporal Intelligence
- **TFT Input**: Temporal patterns suggest optimal stop loss levels based on multi-horizon predictions
- **Quantile-Based Stops**: Use P10/P90 quantiles to set dynamic stop levels with uncertainty bounds
- **RL Decision**: Agent learns when to move stop loss based on attention-weighted market progression
- **Risk Override**: Automatic stop loss adjustment if account protection triggers
- **Adaptive Learning**: System learns from successful/failed stop loss adjustments using temporal context

## 6. Trading Rules and Constraints

### 6.1 Hybrid Decision Framework
#### Pattern-Driven Entry Logic
```python
def should_enter_trade():
    # Temporal Fusion Transformer Analysis
    tft_output = temporal_fusion_transformer.predict(current_market_sequence)
    
    # Enhanced validation with uncertainty measures
    if (tft_output.classification_confidence < 0.7 or 
        tft_output.quantile_uncertainty_spread > 0.3):
        return False
    
    # RL Agent Decision with comprehensive temporal context
    rl_state = create_enhanced_rl_state(
        tft_classification=tft_output.classification_head,
        price_quantiles=tft_output.quantile_predictions,
        attention_weights=tft_output.attention_weights,
        market_context=market_context,
        risk_state=risk_state
    )
    rl_action = rl_agent.act(rl_state)
    
    # Combined Decision with temporal intelligence
    if rl_action in [1, 2] and validate_enhanced_constraints(tft_output):
        return True, rl_action
    return False, None

def validate_enhanced_constraints(tft_output):
    return (not is_asia_session() and 
            can_achieve_2_to_1_rr_with_uncertainty(tft_output.quantiles) and 
            within_risk_limits() and 
            no_current_position() and
            temporal_pattern_stability_check(tft_output.attention_weights))
```

### 6.2 Session Management
#### Asia Session Exclusion (NY Timezone)
```python
# Define Asia session hours (NY time)
asia_session_start = 23  # 11 PM NY time
asia_session_end = 8     # 8 AM NY time

def is_asia_session(current_hour_ny):
    return asia_session_start <= current_hour_ny or current_hour_ny <= asia_session_end
```

### 6.3 Entry Rules
- **Pattern Confidence**: TFT classification confidence > 0.7 required
- **Uncertainty Bounds**: TFT quantile spread within acceptable limits (<0.3)
- **Temporal Stability**: Attention weights show consistent pattern recognition
- **RL Validation**: RL agent must confirm trade execution with enhanced state space
- **2:1 RR Potential**: Both TFT quantiles and RL must validate achievable risk-reward
- **Session Compliance**: No trades during Asia session (11 PM - 8 AM NY time)
- **Single Position**: Enforce one position limit across both systems
- **Risk Limits**: Combined TFT-RL risk assessment within account limits

### 6.4 Exit Rules
- **Predetermined Exits**: Maintain 2:1 RR targets as primary exit strategy
- **RL Override**: Agent can close position early based on learned patterns and TFT uncertainty
- **Pattern Invalidation**: Exit if TFT confidence drops significantly or attention patterns shift
- **Quantile-Based Exits**: Use TFT price quantiles for dynamic exit optimization
- **Risk Protection**: Emergency exits for account protection (10% drawdown limit)
